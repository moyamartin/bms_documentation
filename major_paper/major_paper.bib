In this paper, Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm optimized multi-hidden-layer wavelet neural network (WNN) model and a series of novel intelligent SOC estimation methods using L-M based WNN are proposed. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize L-M based three-layer WNN (LMWNN) for SOC estimation problem. Furthermore, it is validated that L-M based multi-hidden-layer WNN (LMMWNN) has better performance than LMWNN. Basing the specific characteristic of SOC estimation, the LMMWNN method is optimized by combining piecewise-network method (PLMMWNN) and seven-point linear smoothing method (smoothed PLMMWNN). Under single driving cycle, such as the New European Driving Cycle(NEDC), the mean absolute error of PLMMWNN can be decreased to 0.6% and the maximum absolute error 5%. A comparison study of the series of WNN-based methods with BP neural network (BPNN) and extend Kalman filter (EKF) is conducted. The robustness evaluation, which is based on untrained driving cycles test, measurement noise test and piecewise training and batteries test, indicates the good performance on estimation accuracy, applicability and robustness of the proposed methods.}

    abstract = {Battery state-of-charge estimation is an important component in battery management system design. Many known issues with lithium ion batteries such as performance decay, accelerated aging and even hazardous incidents were associated with faulty state-of-charge estimation. Different estimation algorithms can be summarized in a nutshell as: 1) modeless approaches, i.e. columbic counting; 2). model based observers, i.e. extended Kalman filter; and 3). data driven nonlinear models, i.e. neural networks, and learning machines. This paper adopts the third approach, and proposes a new architecture for SoC estimation using a load-classifying neural network. This approach pre-processes battery inputs and categorizes battery operation modes as idle, charge and discharge, with three neural networks trained in parallel. Using a vehicle drive cycle load profile for model training and a pulse test duty cycle for validation, the proposed method yields a 3.8% average estimation error. This result demonstrates that data driven machine learning approach can deliver estimation performance comparable with other advanced observer designs. The neural network however has a simpler model training procedure, boarder choice of training data, and smaller computational cost. In addition, with simple filtering and output constraints, estimation error spikes associated with ‘uncharted’ inputs can be effectively suppressed.}

In this paper, we propose a new SOC estimation based on an optimized support vector machine for regression (SVR) with double search optimization process. Our developed method is tested by simulation experiments in the ADVISOR, with a comparison of the estimations based on artificial neural network (ANN). It is demonstrated that our method is simpler and more accurate than that based on ANN to deal with the SOC estimation task.}

        The OCV (open circuit voltage)-based method for SOC (state of charge) estimation by using the dual neural network fusion battery model is proposed in this paper. The weights of the constructed dual neural network fusion battery model can be used to describe the characteristics of the corresponding parameters of electrochemical model for the battery. The constructed dual neural network fusion battery model consists of two neural network models connected in series. The first part is a linear neural network battery model which can be used to identify parameters of the first-order electrochemical model or second-order electrochemical model for the battery, the second part is a BP (Back of Prorogation) neural network used for capturing the relationship between OCV and SOC. The DST (Dynamic Stress Test) data is adopted for training the dual neural network fusion battery model, by which the relationship between OCV and SOC is offline obtained. Under FUDS (Federal Urban Driving Schedule) condition, the experimental results show that the dual neural network fusion battery model can effectively estimate SOC based on the first-order electrochemical model or second-order electrochemical model.}

    abstract = {A common drawback of the SOC (State of Charge) estimators of EV (electric vehicle) traction batteries nowadays is that they don't consider the difference among individual cells and employ the “averaged SOC” as the state of charge of the pack. Over-charge or over-discharge may happen to the weak cells with this SOC value in vehicular applications. In this study, a novel approach for online pack SOC estimation and correction is proposed, which combines a traditional SOC estimator and an ANFIS (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system). The traditional KF (Kalman filtering) based estimator is applied to firstly estimate the “averaged SOC” of the battery pack, and the ANFIS is then used to online correct the “averaged” SOC estimation with the information of cell differences and loading current. The influence of cell differences on SOC estimation is embodied in the fuzzy rules of the ANFIS, which is trained offline. Validation results by experiments show that, the proposed method has the potential to overcome the drawbacks of traditional SOC estimators caused by cell-to-cell variations in a battery pack, and the corrected SOC is more reasonable than the traditional “averaged SOC”.}

In this paper, a lithium-ion cylindrical battery module with different cells distribution strategy is designed to improve its uniformity. A three-dimensional heat transfer – one-dimensional electrochemical coupled finite element model is developed to analyze and optimize the arrangement for battery module. The intervals of cells are arranged based on geometric ratio and arithmetic ratio. It is found that the arrangement of varying intervals among cells is an efficient way to improve homogeneity for battery module, especially the arithmetic arrangement. The maximum temperature difference of the battery module decreases with increasing initial spacing. The maximum temperature difference of battery module with arithmetic arrangement could reduce 13%, and maximum final voltage difference could reduce to 2.5 mV when battery initial spacing reaches 5.5 mm. The uniformities of temperature and discharge inside the battery module with arithmetic ratio arrangement are better than geometric ratio arrangement. The position of cells with the maximum temperature in the module varies with discharge time, but always appear at same position regardless of the arrangement and initial spacing. The position changing process is slower in arithmetic arrangement and large initial spacing.}

This study compares the ageing behaviour of lithium-ion battery modules with the one of single cells. A capacity-based cell matching procedure is performed to minimise the capacity spread among the blocks of constructed modules. So, the newly introduced state of inhomogeneity (regarding capacity and resistance) is reduced up to 10%, but, however, also observed to increase rather linearly over the modules’ lifetime. The balancing behaviour of the battery management system stays unaffected of this increased inhomogeneity. To gain a deeper insight into the ageing behaviour of multi-cell batteries, the modules are disassembled and analysed in terms of local temperature distribution and cell-to-cell variation. After 1200 equivalent full cycles, the modules show an overall module capacity loss which is about 12%. Thereby, the module ageing study reveals a capacity fade which is even approximately 2% lower compared with the one of single cells. The state of inhomogeneity for capacity of high quality lithium-ion cells after 1200 equivalent full cycles is still smaller than 1%.}

To address this problem, this paper proposed a high power low-cost balancing system, in which the bleeder resistors are removed from the passive balancing methods. By controlling the drive circuits of the Mosfets, the Mosfets is controlled in the amplifier mode and the energy can be discharged by the Mosfets with variable and controllable balancing current. The balancing circuits of the method is fabricated and the experimental validation is established. The experimental results verify that the proposed balancing method can realized the balancing function effectively and the balancing power can be high enough even without bleeder resistors}

Considering battery characteristics, the segmented hybrid control strategy based on cell voltage and state of charge (SOC) is proposed in this paper. The simulation model of equalization circuit with bidirectional fly-back transformer are established. Furthermore, a comparison is made with the proposed hybrid control strategy. The simulation results show that the proposed hybrid control strategy is more capable of effectively enhancing the consistency of batteries.}

    abstract = {the power delivery performance of series and parallel strings connected battery modules or packs is restricted by the worst cells in the string. Each cell has a slightly different capacity and terminal voltage due to manufacturing tolerances and operating conditions. The cell strings tend to loss balance during charging and discharging process. The motivation of this paper is to develop a battery management system (BMS) to monitor and control the temperature, state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) et al. and to increase the efficiency of rechargeable batteries. An active energy balancing system for Lithium-ion battery pack is designed based on the online SOC and SOH estimation. The remainder capacity of the battery is estimated by measuring the terminal voltage for each cell, and the balance system will be triggered when the difference between the SOC of one cell and the average SOC is more or less than a predefined threshold in order to minimize the output voltage ripple. The simulation results indicate that the designed BMS can precisely synchronize the SOC while minimizing the output voltage ripple.}

    abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries have been widely adopted in electric vehicles (EVs), and accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation is of paramount importance for the EV battery management system. Though a number of methods have been proposed, the SOC estimation for Lithium-ion batteries, such as LiFePo4 battery, however, faces two key challenges: the flat open circuit voltage (OCV) vs SOC relationship for some SOC ranges and the hysteresis effect. To address these problems, an integrated approach for real-time model-based SOC estimation of Lithium-ion batteries is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an auto-regression model is adopted to reproduce the battery terminal behaviour, combined with a non-linear complementary model to capture the hysteresis effect. The model parameters, including linear parameters and non-linear parameters, are optimized off-line using a hybrid optimization method that combines a meta-heuristic method (i.e., the teaching learning based optimization method) and the least square method. Secondly, using the trained model, two real-time model-based SOC estimation methods are presented, one based on the real-time battery OCV regression model achieved through weighted recursive least square method, and the other based on the state estimation using the extended Kalman filter method (EKF). To tackle the problem caused by the flat OCV-vs-SOC segments when the OCV-based SOC estimation method is adopted, a method combining the coulombic counting and the OCV-based method is proposed. Finally, modelling results and SOC estimation results are presented and analysed using the data collected from LiFePo4 battery cell. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in particular the joint-EKF method.}
